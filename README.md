Project Priority Matrix (Excel)
This repository contains a Project Priority Matrix built in Microsoft Excel, designed to help evaluate and prioritize projects based on three key factors: Feasibility, Impact, and Size.

ðŸ“Š About the Matrix
The matrix is a simple yet effective decision-making tool to:

Assess project feasibility (ease of implementation),

Estimate potential impact (value or benefits),

Consider size (effort, cost, or scope).

Each project can be compared and scored using these criteria to support better prioritization and planning.
